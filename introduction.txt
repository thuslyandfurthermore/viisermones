THE GNOSTIC JUNG AND THE SEVEN SERMONS TO THE DEAD
STEPHAN A HOELLER 1982
PROLOGUE
PREMONITION OF AN INESCAPABLE WORLD OF SHADOWS

    the year was 1949. a deep covering of snow obscured the outline of the splendid baroque buildings in the old city of innsbruck. the venerable capital of the land of the tyrol seemed depopulated by the grim force of the alpine winter. the wide avenue named after the empress maria theresia, beloved matriarch of a long-vanished united states of eastern europe, was empty of its afternoon strollers, who had fled the elements to find shelter where they could. shelter, especially of the heated variety, was in poor supply to be sure. the scarcity of heating materials left most public and many private buildings without heat. even the historic chambers of Innsbruck's famous university housed shivering masses of heavily clad students huddled around professors whose learning was exceeded only by their discomfort. greengrocers dispiritedly offered their all-too-small store of frostbitten vegetables for sale, while the moroccan spahis and senegalese infantrymen of the french occupational army vociferously cursed the day when their generals decided to station them in this land of snow and ice. happy indeed was the man, the woman, or the child who found it possible to repair to a heated room on a day like this.

    on a small side street of the inner city, two hatted, overcoated and scarved figures were speedily betaking themselves to just such a place of blessedness in the shape of the public reading room maintained for the intellectual enrichment - and incidentally, or not so incidentally, for the physical comfort - of the population by the information service of the united states of america. there, in the midst of books and periodicals printed in several languages, all bearing the ideals of the richest and most generous of the four occupational powers, weary and cold refugees from the tyrolean winter gathered with great frequency. the two figures here referred to were refugees, not only from the elements, but from other, more enduring forms of adversity as well. they were refugees from their nearby homeland, hungary, who had come to reside, even though temporarily, in the sister country, the austrian imperial homeland of the many peoples of eastern europe. the elder of the two compatriots was of singularly impressive appearance and of equally impressive credentials in the fields of learning, religion and public life. professor j. was a priest of the roman catholic church, and until recently a member of the jesuit order, which he relinquished with the official approval of the church, while retaining his priestly status. for many years he was known as one of the outstanding luminaries of the academic world of his hungarian university. he was the author of numerous learned books on philosophy, and a recognized expert on existentialism, personally acquainted with heidegger, jaspers, and jean paul sartre. in 1945 his name was one of several nominated for the leading archbishopric of hungary, which entailed the leadership of the church of the entire nation, but he was by-passed in favor of the heroic and tragic prelate, cardinal mindszenty, whose imprisonment scandalized the entire world just a few brief years later. at this time professor j. was living in quiet semi-retirement in austria, an austere and mysterious figure, known to but a few of his countrymen and having personal contact with even fewer. one of the elect whom he conversed with regularly was his present companion on his wintry walk, a young and precocious student of philosophy with aspirations toward entering the priesthood. this young man - none other than the writer of the present treatise - had strangely arrested the attention of the reclusive professor who seemed to be amused by his great attraction to religion, coupled with unconventional thinking and youthful flamboyance. "i like you, my young baron," he said on their first meeting; "in an earlier age you might have become a real heretic and would have been burned by the dominicans!" these promising opening remarks led to a friendship, punctuated by almost daily meetings at the reading room of the american library, and on rare occasions of momentary prosperity at a nearby cafe, over turkish coffee and french cognac.
    "we may have a treat for you this afternoon," the professor said to his companion. "a strange book is on its way to us that will assuredly interest you."
    "a strange book? of what content and authorship?"
    "i am told it concerns your old friends, the gnostic heretics, whom you never cease to rave about - and moreover it was written by another man you are interested in, the redoubtable dr. jung."
    "the swiss psychologist, who lives across the mountains from here, and who is reputed to be a regular wizard in the good old tradition of witches and alchemists?" the young man asked, not without some excitement.
    "the very same. the 'hexenmeister' [warlock] of zurich himself."
    
    the intriguing news thus having been announced by the professor, the two frostbitten travelers entered the reading room, and after shedding their snow-covered overgarments, settled comfortably down to a large and suitably deserted table in the far end of the room. the austrian girl librarian reverently curtsied to the "hochwurdiger herr" [reverend gentleman] in her accustomed fashion, while depositiong several publications of the professor's usual reading material before him. the two companions enveloped themselves in an etheric cloud of quiet and scholarly comfort, greatly augmented by the pleasant warmth of the room, so generously heated by the funds of the marshall plan. an hour passed

    the opening of the door and the excited whispers of the librarian heralded the arrival of the expected bearer of heretical and psychological wonders, who - according to professor j. - was to join them in their present shelter. they were approached by a small, rather unprepossessing individual whose two unusual characteristics, a bulky briefcase of enormous size and a clerical collar projecting from his shabby black overcoat, soon revealed him to be none other than father z., an itinerant hungarian priest, whose calling involved frequent traveling in the countries of austria, switzerland and italy.

    the visitor approached the table and solemnly bowed to the professor.
    "laudetur jesus christus," [praise be to jesus christ] he said in the traditional manner of the latin greeting of the monastic clergy of hungary.
    "in aeternum. amen," [in all eternity. amen.] the professor and his associate answered in the proper manner, while the visitor silently established himself in an empty seat at the table occupied by his compatriots. in hushed but discreetly audible tones, there now ensued a conversation of considerable length. the topic initially and understandably was of matters close at hand and dear to the anxious heart. the newest moves of the communist dictatorship in hungary were recounted; the most recent arrests of priests and nuns, the show-trials of members of the higher clergy, the capture and imprisonment of ill-fated friends and relatives. the whispered hopes of the exile community, the possible fall of the russian-supported tyranny due to political pressures from western nations, the hopes of the vatican, the vacillations of politicians the world over, the plight of the numerous refugees in camps and other facilities all over western europe - these and other related matters were recounted and discussed to the accompaniment of furrowed brows and distressed glances. finally, the urgencies having abated and anxious inquiries answered, it was time to attend to the long-awaited matter.
    
    "my friend," the professor said, revealing a portentious deliberateness in his voice, "you have told me this morning of a small book by doctor jung. have you brought it along?"
    father z. slowly and carefully unlocked his briefcase and began to search in its amply filled recesses. after a few minutes he drew forth a smallish volume and deposited it on the table where both the professor and his young friend could both view it with ease. the professor opened the volume and turned it at an angle where the light would illumine the pages in the most efficient manner. all three men looked with rapt attention. before them reposed an expensively bound small book, printed in highly decorative type on parchment-like artistic paper. the initial letters of the short chapters resembled nothing more than the elaborate initials in medieval manuscripts, and the text on each page was enclused by a frame, leaving the margins of great width, whereon the page numbers were noted in roman numerals. the text of the book was in german, as one could note at a glance on account of the old-fashioned gothic german type, long since fallen into disuse. in spite of the german text, the book bore a latin title, elaborately and artistically lettered on the front page. it read:

VII SERMONES AD MORTUOS

    the author was identified in a line below the title as BASILIDES, and the place of writing as ALEXANDRIA, THE CITY WHERE EAST AND WEST MEET.
    the young man flushed and drew himself up as though he had been struck. laboriously and with bated breath, he asked the priest: "professor j. told us, and you seemed to agree, that the book was written by dr. jung. why is it then that it bears the name of basilides, the famous gnostic heretic of alexandria in egypt? are you sure you have the correct book?"
    "yes, baron, it is the right book, the seven sermons to the dead. let me quickly tell you its history, so that you will understand. it was written by dr. carl jung in 1916 but was never published for the use of the public. this is a very rare copy from the edition printed privately by jung for the use of some of his closest friends. in fact, this volume was given by jung long ago to a doctor in holland, who before his death gave it to an italian prelate who was visiting the dutch church and who was most interested in psychology. the old monsignore, who is now at the vatican, gave it to me for very similar reasons. as you may have heard, dr. jung has a more than ordinary interest in the teachings of the old gnostics, and so he used the name of basilides as a nom de plume in this particular instance."
    "he is not the only one with a fascination for the gnostics," smiled professor j. "the young baron is quite heretical himself. but let us look at the book further."
    the text of the volume was most certainly as outlandish and fascinating as the title page promised. the first chapter, entitled "SERMO I," began with the ominous sentence in german:

DIE TOTEN KAMEN ZURUCK VON JERUSALEM, WO SIE NICHT FANDEN, WAS SIE SUCHTEN. SIE BEGEHRTEN BEI MIR EINLASS UND VERLANGTEN BEI MIR LEHRE UND SO LEHRTE ICH SIE:
HORET: ICH BEGINNE BEIM NICHTS, DAS NICHTS IST DASSELBE WIE DIE FULLE. IN DER UNENDLICHKEIT IST VOLL SO GUT WIE LEER. DAS NICHTS IST LEER UND VOLL. IHR KONNT AUCH EBENSO GUT ETWAS ANDERES VOM NICHTS SAGEN, Z.B.ES SEI WEISS ODER SCHWARZ ODER ES SEI NICHT, ODER ES SEI. EIN UNENDLICHES UND EWIGES HAT KEINE EIGENSHAFTEN, WEIL ES ALLE EIGENSCHAFTEN HAT...

THE DEAD CAME BACK FROM JERUSALEM, WHERE THEY DID NOT FIND WHAT THEY WERE SEEKING. THEY ASKED ADMITTANCE TO ME AND DEMANDED TO BE TAUGHT BY ME, AND THUS I TAUGHT THEM:
HEAR YE: I BEGIN WITH NOTHING. NOTHING IS THE SAME AS FULLNESS. IN THE ENDLESS STATE FULLNESS IS THE SAME AS EMPTINESS. THE NOTHING IS BOTH EMPTY AND FULL. ONE MAY JUST AS WELL STATE SOME OTHER THING ABOUT THE NOTHING, NAMELY, THAT IT IS WHITE OR THAT IT IS BLACK OR THAT IT EXISTS OR THAT IT EXISTS NOT. THAT WHICH IS ENDLESS AND ETERNAL HAS NO QUALITIES BECAUSE IT HAS ALL QUALITIES...

    they read on in the first chapter, or sermon, until the young man addressed the professor: "what is all this obscurity? i recognize the word PLEROMA, the plenum of which the old gnostics wrote, and a few other ideas which i have seen expressed by the fathers who wrote about, or rather against the gnostics. i cannot understand this so-called sermon at all!"
    the professor replied at once: "it is a description of the absolute, the indescribable. no wonder doctor jung has a difficult time with it. do you remember the mystical darkness intimated by dionysius the areopagite? or the poetic vagueness of the descriptions of meister eckhart? jung was no doubt confronted with a task which these earlier mystics had also encountered. read on!"
    a page bearing the heading "SERMO III" arrested their attention next:

THE DEAD APPROACHED LIKE MIST OUT OF THE SWAMPS AND THEY SHOUTED: "SPEAK TO US FURTHER ABOUT THE HIGHEST GOD."
- ABRAXAS IS A GOD WHOM IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW. HIS POWER IS THE VERY GREATEST, BECAUSE MAN DOES NOT PERCEIVE IT ALL. MAN SEES THE SUMMUM BONUM OF THE SUN, AND ALSO THE INFINUM MALUM OF THE DEVIL, BUT ABRAXAS, HE DOES NOT SEE, FOR HE IS UNDEFINABLE LIFE ITSELF, WHICH IS THE MOTHER OF GOOD AND EVIL ALIKE.

    professor j. interrupted the reading of the text. "oh yes - abraxas. the gnostic universal ruler, whose head is like that of a rooster. how much more colorful our holy pictures and statues would be if we had retained some of these strange gnostic deities. surely one gets tired even of the image of our lord jesus, especially here in austria, where he is always covered in gold leaf. but, never mind, jung has really got something with his description of the old rooster-god. i must say this is impressive poetry, to say the least! listen to this!"
    and he read on, in a steady, though subdued voice:

HE IS FULLNESS, UNITING ITSELF WITH EMPTINESS.
HE IS THE SACRED WEDDING;
HE IS LOVE AND THE MURDER OF LOVE;
HE IS THE HOLY ONE AND THE BETRAYER.

HE IS THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT OF DAY AND THE DEEPEST NIGHT OF MADNESS.

TO SEE HIM MEANS BLINDNESS;
TO KNOW HIM IS SICKNESS;
TO WORSHIP HIM IS DEATH;
TO FEAR HIM IS WISDOM;
NOT TO RESIST HIM MEANS LIBERATION.

    after a brief interval of silence, he once again began to read aloud:

SUCH IS THE TERRIBLE ABRAXAS.

HE IS THE MIGHTIES MANIFEST BEING, AND IN HIM CREATION BECOMES FRIGHTENED OF ITSELF.
HE IS THE REVEALED PROTEST OF CREATION AGAINST THE PLEROMA AND ITS NOTHINGNESS.
HE IS THE TERROR OF THE SON, WHICH HE FEELS AGAINST HIS MOTHER.
HE IS THE LOVE OF THE MOTHER FOR HER SON.
HE IS THE DELIGHT OF EARTH AND THE CRUELTY OF HEAVEN.
MAN BECOMES PARALYZED BEFORE HIS FACE.
BEFORE HIM THERE EXIST NEITHER QUESTION NOR ANSWER.
HE IS THE LIFE OF CREATION.
HE IS THE ACTIVITY OF DIFFERENTIATION.
HE IS THE LOVE OF MAN.
HE IS THE SPEECH OF MAN.
HE IS BOTH THE RADIANCE AND THE DARK SHADOW OF MAN.
HE IS DECEITFUL REALITY.

    "this jung is truly a poet," the priestly bearer of large briefcases and rare books interjected. "this passage is worthy of goethe, or at least of our most philisophical hungarian poet, endre ady, who called god a terrible shark."
    "shark or rooster, it is very much the same thing. god is terror and darkness just as much as he is love and light. how else can one explain auschwitz, and the torture chambers in siberia and in budapest managed by stalin and his servants?" professor j. shook his head, his long white hair rearranging itself in untidy waves over his forehead.
    "but are these dark and horrible deeds not the province of the devil, rather than of god?" father z. asked.
    "not at all, my friend. the swiss doctor rightly says in this little book that there are countless gods and devils. and incidentally, what is a devil anyway? the church calls him a fallen angel, and so he is. but where did he fall from? from god's kingdom of greatness, or from the PLEROMA or fullness, as it is called here. to fall means to descend, to come down from on high. so the devils are beings who have come down from god to the lowest of all levels of creation, called hell. some think that the word diabolos really means little god. these little evil gods may indeed be responsible for instigating some errors, but the final responsibility for all good and evil must devolve on god. and this is precisely why jung's abraxas is a more accurate image of god than the one we hold, when we follow st. thomas and our theologians, who say that evil is only an absence of good. the german and russian death camps and their authors are not merely lacking in good; they are evil."
    it was time for the youngest of the threesome to cautiously chide his elder: "it seems, professor, that this time you are the one who speaks like a gnostic heretic. surely a god who is both evil and good at the same time would be a most unsatisfactory object of worship for the people"
    "if under 'people' you mean the masses of believers, then you are of course correct. still, your gnostic friends of olden days would have said that knowledge of god is more important than knowledge of god, and in order to know god one must also know evil."
    "i agree with you that this is what the gnostics would have said, but what do you say, professor?"
    "i shall ask myself if what i would say is both wise and necessary. and so i will say nothing."
    "still spoken like a jesuit," muttered father z., instantly regretting his impulsive statement.
    "be it as it may, jesuits have been known to survive when most others succumb." the professor turned his attention once more to the book.

    the survey of the book was nearing its end. the last chapter offered itself to the gaze of the three readers. entitled "SERMO VII" and bearing the page number XVII in roman numerals, it began with a huge illuminated initial which was a gothic letter D:

DES NACHTS ABER KAMEN DIE TOTEN WIEDER MIT KLAGLICHER GEBARDE UND SPRACHEN: NOCH EINES, WIR VERGASSEN DAVON ZU REDEN, LEHRE UNS VOM MENSCHEN...

AT NIGHT THE DEAD CAME BACK AGAIN AND AMIDST COMPLAINING SAID: "ONE MORE THING WE MUST KNOW, BECAUSE WE HAD FORGOTTEN TO DISCUSS IT: TEACH US CONCERNING MAN."

- MAN IS A PORTAL THROUGH WHICH ONE ENTERS FROM THE OUTER WORLD OF THE GODS, DEMONS AND SOULS, INTO THE INNER WORLD - FROM THE GREATER WORLD INTO THE SMALLER WORLD. SMALL AND INSIGNIFICANT IS MAN; ONE LEAVES HIM SOON BEGIND, AND THUS ONE ENTERS ONCE MORE INTO INFINITE SPACE, INTO THE MICROCOSM, INTO THE INNER ETERNITY.

IN IMMEASURABLE DISTANCE THERE GLIMMERS A SOLITARY STAR ON THE HIGHEST POINT OF HEAVEN. THIS IS THE ONLY GOD OF THIS LONELY ONE. THIS IS HIS WORLD, HIS PLEROMA, HIS DIVINITY.

IN THIS WORLD MAN IS ABRAXAS, WHO GIVES BIRTH TO AND DEVOURS HIS OWN WORLD.
THIS STAR IS MAN'S GOD AND GOAL.
IT IS HIS GUIDING DIVINITY: IN IT MAN FINDS REPOSE.

TO IT GOES THE LONG JOURNET OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH; IN IT SHINE ALL THINGS WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT KEEP MAN FROM THE GREATER WORLD WITH THE BRILLIANCE OF A GREAT LIGHT.

TO THIS ONE, MAN OUGHT PRAY.
SUCH A PRAYER INCREASES THE LIGHT OF THE STAR.
SUCH A PRAYER BUILDS A BRIDGE OVER DEATH.
IT INCREASES THE LIFE OF THE MICROCOSM; WHEN THE OUTER WORLD GROWS COLD, THIS STAR STILL SHINES.

THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN SEPARATE MAN FROM HIS OWN GOD, IF MAN CAN ONLY TURN HIS GAZE AWAY FROM THE FIERY SPECTACLE OF ABRAXAS.

MAN HERE, GOD THERE. WEAKNESS AND INSIGNIFICANCE HERE, ETERNAL CREATIVE POWER THERE.
HERE IS BUT DARKNESS AND DAMP COLD. THERE ALL IS SUNSINE

UPON HEARING THIS THE DEAD FELL SILENT, AND THEY ROSE UP LIKE SMOKE RISES OVER THE FIRE OF THE SHEPHERD, WHO GUARDS HIS FLOCK BY NIGHT

    the text ended with four lines of barbarous words, entitled "anagramma," indicating ostensibly an attempt on the part of dr. jung to disguise some secret and personal message, but possibly also containing a magical sequence of gnostic formulae in the manner frequently found in late egyptian sources.

    the three readers glanced at each other in a uniformly significant fashion. a chill spirit of awe and amazement seemed to have risen at the table. even the owner of the book, whose acquaintance with its contents extended over a number of years, was visibly affected. no one spoke for several minutes.

    the silence was broken by professor j.: "dr. jung is a seer and a mystic after the fashion of the magicians of the renaissance. i have known for some time that there is more to him than meets the academic eye. unlike freud, he is not fearful of the dark mysteries of the spirit. among his friends and supporters are people of unconventional and peculiar affiliations and interests. i hear that one of his italian pupils is a theosophist, while an english follower, who is also a doctor, became a devotee of a russian wizard. there must also be some contact between him and the group founded by the austrian mystic rudolf steiner, whose headquarters is in switzerland. it is known to most of us that dr. jung was fascinated by the phenomena of spiritism and that he got his doctorate by writing a thesis on occult phenomena. some think that he is a spiritual pagan, while others accuse him of being biased in the direction of christianity. this little book would set both of those opinions in the wrong, for it shows that he is a kind of gnostic, which would take him out of the categories of pagan and christian. i am certainly pleased to have perused this remarkable document, and i am thankful to you father."

    the mild-mannered priest barely had opportunity to acknowledge the professor's comments when their younger companion burst into the conversation with even more than his usual ardor: "and i am truly thankful beyond measure and beyond words also. i am greatly concerned, however, since i recall that you said to us that this book is quite unobtainable. i wish i could memorize its contents by heart so as to retain every word. if i ever encountered a book i should like to own, this is assuredly the one!"
    "it may not be necessary to thus tax your memory, baron, for i am not leaving innsbruck until tomorrow night, and you may be able to copy these few pages without much difficulty by then. just be so kind and return the book to me before five o'clock tomorrow. i am lodged at the franciscan monastery, not far from here."

    he handed the book to his happy compatriot, who with trembling hand grasped it and carefully hid it in the inner pocket of his overcoat. "i will copy it tonight. you may have it as early as you wish, even before morning mass."

    outside, the early darkness of winter had fallen. the reading room had become well-nigh empty of patrons, and the librarian was obviously preparing to close the doors. after polite expressions of good wishes, the three companions donned their coats and other protective clothing and exited from the premises. the winter evening received them in due fashion, and after a short walk together they dispersed to take up their individual journeys to their previous quarters. a remarkable day had come to a close.

    not quite. one of the company was certainly not prepared to see his day come to a close. no knight of the round table could have carried the holy grail with greater reverence than the hungarian student carried that copy of jung's seven sermons to the dead. the cold and slow-moving streetcar, the walk from the termincal to his quarters in an outlying district of the city, the frantic preparations involving the securing of adequate quantities of paper and of a sturdy fountain pen - these activities took on the nimbus of events on a journey to a place where a lifetime of toil and expectancy would be rewarded and crowned. the kitchen, hallowed locale of culinary alchemical operations, was speedily turned into a nocturnal scriptorium, and the enthusiastic scribe plunged with utmost dedication unto one of the most magical activities of his young life.
