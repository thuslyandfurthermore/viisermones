THE GNOSTIC JUNG AND THE SEVEN SERMONS TO THE DEAD
STEPHAN A HOELLER 1982
PROLOGUE
PREMONITION OF AN INESCAPABLE WORLD OF SHADOWS

    the year was 1949. a deep covering of snow obscured the outline of the splendid baroque buildings in the old city of innsbruck. the venerable capital of the land of the tyrol seemed depopulated by the grim force of the alpine winter. the wide avenue named after the empress maria theresia, beloved matriarch of a long-vanished united states of eastern europe, was empty of its afternoon strollers, who had fled the elements to find shelter where they could. shelter, especially of the heated variety, was in poor supply to be sure. the scarcity of heating materials left most public and many private buildings without heat. even the historic chambers of Innsbruck's famous university housed shivering masses of heavily clad students huddled around professors whose learning was exceeded only by their discomfort. greengrocers dispiritedly offered their all-too-small store of frostbitten vegetables for sale, while the moroccan spahis and senegalese infantrymen of the french occupational army vociferously cursed the day when their generals decided to station them in this land of snow and ice. happy indeed was the man, the woman, or the child who found it possible to repair to a heated room on a day like this.

    on a small side street of the inner city, two hatted, overcoated and scarved figures were speedily betaking themselves to just such a place of blessedness in the shape of the public reading room maintained for the intellectual enrichment - and incidentally, or not so incidentally, for the physical comfort - of the population by the information service of the united states of america. there, in the midst of books and periodicals printed in several languages, all bearing the ideals of the richest and most generous of the four occupational powers, weary and cold refugees from the tyrolean winter gathered with great frequency. the two figures here referred to were refugees, not only from the elements, but from other, more enduring forms of adversity as well. they were refugees from their nearby homeland, hungary, who had come to reside, even though temporarily, in the sister country, the austrian imperial homeland of the many peoples of eastern europe. the elder of the two compatriots was of singularly impressive appearance and of equally impressive credentials in the fields of learning, religion and public life. professor j. was a priest of the roman catholic church, and until recently a member of the jesuit order, which he relinquished with the official approval of the church, while retaining his priestly status. for many years he was known as one of the outstanding luminaries of the academic world of his hungarian university. he was the author of numerous learned books on philosophy, and a recognized expert on existentialism, personally acquainted with heidegger, jaspers, and jean paul sartre. in 1945 his name was one of several nominated for the leading archbishopric of hungary, which entailed the leadership of the church of the entire nation, but he was by-passed in favor of the heroic and tragic prelate, cardinal mindszenty, whose imprisonment scandalized the entire world just a few brief years later. at this time professor j. was living in quiet semi-retirement in austria, an austere and mysterious figure, known to but a few of his countrymen and having personal contact with even fewer. one of the elect whom he conversed with regularly was his present companion on his wintry walk, a young and precocious student of philosophy with aspirations toward entering the priesthood. this young man - none other than the writer of the present treatise - had strangely arrested the attention of the reclusive professor who seemed to be amused by his great attraction to religion, coupled with unconventional thinking and youthful flamboyance. "i like you, my young baron," he said on their first meeting; "in an earlier age you might have become a real heretic and would have been burned by the dominicans!" these promising opening remarks led to a friendship, punctuated by almost daily meetings at the reading room of the american library, and on rare occasions of momentary prosperity at a nearby cafe, over turkish coffee and french cognac.
    "we may have a treat for you this afternoon," the professor said to his companion. "a strange book is on its way to us that will assuredly interest you."
    "a strange book? of what content and authorship?"
    "i am told it concerns your old friends, the gnostic heretics, whom you never cease to rave about - and moreover it was written by another man you are interested in, the redoubtable dr. jung."
    "the swiss psychologist, who lives across the mountains from here, and who is reputed to be a regular wizard in the good old tradition of witches and alchemists?" the young man asked, not without some excitement.
    "the very same. the 'hexenmeister' [warlock] of zurich himself."
    
    the intriguing news thus having been announced by the professor, the two frostbitten travelers entered the reading room, and after shedding their snow-covered overgarments, settled comfortably down to a large and suitably deserted table in the far end of the room. the austrian girl librarian reverently curtsied to the "hochwurdiger herr" [reverend gentleman] in her accustomed fashion, while depositiong several publications of the professor's usual reading material before him. the two companions enveloped themselves in an etheric cloud of quiet and scholarly comfort, greatly augmented by the pleasant warmth of the room, so generously heated by the funds of the marshall plan. an hour passed

    the opening of the door and the excited whispers of the librarian heralded the arrival of the expected bearer of heretical and psychological wonders, who - according to professor j. - was to join them in their present shelter. they were approached by a small, rather unprepossessing individual whose two unusual characteristics, a bulky briefcase of enormous size and a clerical collar projecting from his shabby black overcoat, soon revealed him to be none other than father z., an itinerant hungarian priest, whose calling involved frequent traveling in the countries of austria, switzerland and italy.

    the visitor approached the table and solemnly bowed to the professor.
    "laudetur jesus christus," [praise be to jesus christ] he said in the traditional manner of the latin greeting of the monastic clergy of hungary.
    "in aeternum. amen," [in all eternity. amen.] the professor and his associate answered in the proper manner, while the visitor silently established himself in an empty seat at the table occupied by his compatriots. in hushed but discreetly audible tones, there now ensued a conversation of considerable length. the topic initially and understandably was of matters close at hand and dear to the anxious heart. the newest moves of the communist dictatorship in hungary were recounted; the most recent arrests of priests and nuns, the show-trials of members of the higher clergy, the capture and imprisonment of ill-fated friends and relatives. the whispered hopes of the exile community, the possible fall of the russian-supported tyranny due to political pressures from western nations, the hopes of the vatican, the vacillations of politicians the world over, the plight of the numerous refugees in camps and other facilities all over western europe - these and other related matters were recounted and discussed to the accompaniment of furrowed brows and distressed glances. finally, the urgencies having abated and anxious inquiries answered, it was time to attend to the long-awaited matter.
    
    "my friend," the professor said, revealing a portentious deliberateness in his voice, "you have told me this morning of a small book by doctor jung. have you brought it along?"
    father z. slowly and carefully unlocked his briefcase and began to search in its amply filled recesses. after a few minutes he drew forth a smallish volume and deposited it on the table where both the professor and his young friend could both view it with ease. the professor opened the volume and turned it at an angle where the light would illumine the pages in the most efficient manner. all three men looked with rapt attention. before them reposed an expensively bound small book, printed in highly decorative type on parchment-like artistic paper. the initial letters of the short chapters resembled nothing more than the elaborate initials in medieval manuscripts, and the text on each page was enclused by a frame, leaving the margins of great width, whereon the page numbers were noted in roman numerals. the text of the book was in german, as one could note at a glance on account of the old-fashioned gothic german type, long since fallen into disuse. in spite of the german text, the book bore a latin title, elaborately and artistically lettered on the front page. it read:

VII SERMONES AD MORTUOS

    the author was identified in a line below the title as BASILIDES, and the place of writing as ALEXANDRIA, THE CITY WHERE EAST AND WEST MEET.
    the young man flushed and drew himself up as though he had been struck. laboriously and with bated breath, he asked the priest: "professor j. told us, and you seemed to agree, that the book was written by dr. jung. why is it then that it bears the name of basilides, the famous gnostic heretic of alexandria in egypt? are you sure you have the correct book?"
    "yes, baron, it is the right book, the seven sermons to the dead. let me quickly tell you its history, so that you will understand. it was written by dr. carl jung in 1916 but was never published for the use of the public. this is a very rare copy from the edition printed privately by jung for the use of some of his closest friends. in fact, this volume was given by jung long ago to a doctor in holland, who before his death gave it to an italian prelate who was visiting the dutch church and who was most interested in psychology. the old monsignore, who is now at the vatican, gave it to me for very similar reasons. as you may have heard, dr. jung has a more than ordinary interest in the teachings of the old gnostics, and so he used the name of basilides as a nom de plume in this particular instance."
    "he is not the only one with a fascination for the gnostics," smiled professor j. "the young baron is quite heretical himself. but let us look at the book further."
    the text of the volume was most certainly as outlandish and fascinating as the title page promised. the first chapter, entitled "SERMO I," began with the ominous sentence in german:

DIE TOTEN KAMEN ZURUCK VON JERUSALEM, WO SIE NICHT FANDEN, WAS SIE SUCHTEN. SIE BEGEHRTEN BEI MIR EINLASS UND VERLANGTEN BEI MIR LEHRE UND SO LEHRTE ICH SIE:
HORET: ICH BEGINNE BEIM NICHTS, DAS NICHTS IST DASSELBE WIE DIE FULLE. IN DER UNENDLICHKEIT IST VOLL SO GUT WIE LEER. DAS NICHTS IST LEER UND VOLL. IHR KONNT AUCH EBENSO GUT ETWAS ANDERES VOM NICHTS SAGEN, Z.B.ES SEI WEISS ODER SCHWARZ ODER ES SEI NICHT, ODER ES SEI. EIN UNENDLICHES UND EWIGES HAT KEINE EIGENSHAFTEN, WEIL ES ALLE EIGENSCHAFTEN HAT...

THE DEAD CAME BACK FROM JERUSALEM, WHERE THEY DID NOT FIND WHAT THEY WERE SEEKING. THEY ASKED ADMITTANCE TO ME AND DEMANDED TO BE TAUGHT BY ME, AND THUS I TAUGHT THEM:
HEAR YE: I BEGIN WITH NOTHING. NOTHING IS THE SAME AS FULLNESS. IN THE ENDLESS STATE FULLNESS IS THE SAME AS EMPTINESS. THE NOTHING IS BOTH EMPTY AND FULL. ONE MAY JUST AS WELL STATE SOME OTHER THING ABOUT THE NOTHING, NAMELY, THAT IT IS WHITE OR THAT IT IS BLACK OR THAT IT EXISTS OR THAT IT EXISTS NOT. THAT WHICH IS ENDLESS AND ETERNAL HAS NO QUALITIES BECAUSE IT HAS ALL QUALITIES...

    they read on in the first chapter, or sermon, until the young man addressed the professor: "what is all this obscurity? i recognize the word PLEROMA, the plenum of which the old gnostics wrote, and a few other ideas which i have seen expressed by the fathers who wrote about, or rather against the gnostics. i cannot understand this so-called sermon at all!"
    the professor replied at once: "it is a description of the absolute, the indescribable. no wonder doctor jung has a difficult time with it. do you remember the mystical darkness intimated by dionysius the areopagite? or the poetic vagueness of the descriptions of meister eckhart? jung was no doubt confronted with a task which these earlier mystics had also encountered. read on!"
    a page bearing the heading "SERMO III" arrested their attention next:

THE DEAD APPROACHED LIKE MIST OUT OF THE SWAMPS AND THEY SHOUTED: "SPEAK TO US FURTHER ABOUT THE HIGHEST GOD."
ABRAXAS IS A GOD WHOM IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW. HIS POWER IS THE VERY GREATEST, BECAUSE MAN DOES NOT PERCEIVE IT ALL. MAN SEES THE SUMMUM BONUM OF THE SUN, AND ALSO THE INFINUM MALUM OF THE DEVIL, BUT ABRAXAS, HE DOES NOT SEE, FOR HE IS UNDEFINABLE LIFE ITSELF, WHICH IS THE MOTHER OF GOOD AND EVIL ALIKE.

    professor j. interrupted the reading of the text. "oh yes - abraxas. the gnostic universal ruler, whose head is like that of a rooster. how much more colorful our holy pictures and statues would be if we had retained some of these strange gnostic
